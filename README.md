# Welcome to the CodeMash Design System Workshop!!!

This repository is for the design system workshop at the CodeMash conference.

## Installation

The wifi at the conference is not always super fast or consistent (especially if everyone is downloading assets at the same time). Before coming to conference please make sure the following items are installed on your laptop:

- [Figma Desktop](https://www.figma.com/downloads/) - please also create a personal account
- [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/) - _LTS_ or _Latest_ should both work fine. Also, `NPM` is installed with `Node.js`
- Download this repository
- Install the package dependencies for the coding project using the following command (make sure you are in directory you downloaded from GitHub)

```bash
cd codemash-design-system && npm i
```

## Using the Content

The `presentations` will all be in PowerPoint and you should be able to be run locally.

The `codemash-design-system.fig` file can be imported using the Figma Desktop application. You can also run the web application of Figma, but since there is no guarantee on how good the internet connection will be, I highly recommend installing the desktop application and running it locally, if possible.

You will find instruction on running code in the `/codemash-design-system/README.md` file.
